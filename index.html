		<h3>Adventure Game. By Jonathan Charleston</h3>
		<p>I built a Text based adventure game for DT and realised halfway through how grossly I had underestimated hard-coders. However, I pressed on and made a 5% finished project. maybe not make a game from nothing next time. The program used was a simple text editor and the code was built from scratch. It was a tough and arduous project</p>
		<h3>Rom hack of Pokemon Emerald</h3>
		<p>This project was supposed to recreate the first few towns and routes from the sinnoh games in a 8-bit style. during this project i found that Advance map is a chunky and difficuld program. Not even having an undo function, Advance Map is one the the most difficult programs to hack roms that i have found so far. it is powerful but clunky</p>
		<h3>RPG Maker XP Game</h3>
		<p>For this project i build a short adventure fantasy adventure that never actually started. The goal was to create something playable in one way or another and I think that I acheived that at least. however i also realised that I was too involved in world building, this all happened much too late however so that there wasn't any time to create a REALLY playable game in any way. It was a learning experience at least and it made me think that making at least a demo for a game is possible with only one person, even I nearly made one. If i had more time and managed my time better i could have made somthing that resembles a demo but I coudn't, and I didn't, so here we are. There wasn't much story to the game, just simple elements like the world was nearly destroyed during a world war three and then the economy collapsed and started again from scratch.</p>
