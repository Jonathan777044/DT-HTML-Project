			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
				I have a problem with “requiring” the best sprites, the best backgrounds, the cleanest code, and 
				the neatest GUI. I can’t have these things without paying for them it seems and the looking 
				process takes way to long, so I get very little done. The game I was designing was supposed 
				to be a sort of rouge-like rpg but I ended up at the last day completely changing course and making a completely 
				different game instead, that game is still going to be called Knightfall but it will be more like 
				angry birds instead of an action RPG.
				</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>A man that walks from side to side, but isn't affected by gravity</li>
					<li>A bunch of blocks that ARE affected by gravity and don’t stack over each other</li>
					<li>One Block that doesn’t get affected by gravity but stops the gravity affected blocks from passing through it</li>
					<li>A bunch of sprites for possible characters</li>
					<li>A background</li>
				</ul>
